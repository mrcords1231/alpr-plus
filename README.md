# ALPR+
ALPR+ is one of Stealth22PD's mods for LSPDFR, I had gone and fixed this to work on the latest LSPDFR(0.4.9) because I needed an ALPR system with an API for one of my projects, hopefully this will be useful to somebody!

Check [releases](https://github.com/mrcords1231/alpr-plus/releases/) to get the compiled version!
